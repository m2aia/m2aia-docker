Novel strategies for remote interaction with biomedical image data were implemented, with a focus on remote processing of multi-modal MSI datasets. Particular attention was paid to providing a flexible system for the development of new image-based processing methods while facilitating collaboration by facilitating access to remote image data collections. A containerization strategy was developed and several image processing applications were packaged for interactive remote access via a standard web browser. To facilitate the use of application containers during development, a container management extension was designed and implemented.
