M²aia (Mass spectrometry imaging applications for interactive analysis in MITK) is a software tool enabling interactive signal processing and visualisation of mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) datasets. M²aia extends the open source Medical Imaging and Interaction Toolkit (MITK) [1,2] and provides powerful methods that the MSI community can adopt, exploit and improve further.

M²aia provides features for

- Read/write access to the open standard imzML
- Image interaction and visualization
- Signal processing: Normalization, baseline correction, smoothing and peak picking
- Image segmentation
- Dimensionality reduction
- Multi-modal 2D registration
- 3D MSI reconstruction
